***exporting a course***

SELECT id,name from Course;

do something with a menu, set {java courseID}

SELECT id, name from Session where courseID = {java courseID}
(and keep this for later)

output header row:
	output "First name,Surname,ID number,", 
	output names of sessions
	end row

SELECT DISTINCT Student.firstName, Student.lastName, Student.id
	FROM Student, Attendance, Session
	WHERE Student.id = Attendance.studentID
		AND Attendance.sessionID = Session.id
		AND Session.courseID = {java courseID}

for each student:
	output firstName
	output lastName
	output studentID
	for each session (that we got earlier):
		SELECT status from Attendance
			WHERE Attendance.studentID = {java studentID}
				AND Attendance.sessionID = {java sessionID}
		output status
	end row

(be careful of the order of sessions!)



***exporting a student***

ouput header row "Course,ID number,Assignment,Mark\n"

SELECT name,id from Student;

do something with a menu, set {java studentID}

SELECT Course.name, Course.id, Session.name, Attendance.status
	FROM Course, Session, Attendance
		WHERE Course.id = Session.courseID
			AND Session.id = Attendance.sessionID
			AND Attendance.studentID = {java studentID}

for each query row: output row



***get session data for editing***

SELECT id, name from Course

do something with a menu, set {java courseID}

SELECT id,name from Session
	WHERE courseID={java courseID}

do something with a menu, set {java sessionID}

SELECT Student.id, Student.name, Attendance.status
	FROM Student,Attendance
		WHERE Student.id = Attendance.studentID
		AND Attendance.sessionID = {java sessionID}

for each query row: display menu row (with index number for editing)
(and keep results of this query in java)



***edit attendance row***

get menu number and new status (present/absent/mv) from user
lookup studentID in Java for this menu number

UPDATE Attendance SET status={java status}
	WHERE studentID = {java studentID}
		AND sessionID = {java sessionID}



***import barcodes***

set {java sessionID} same as for "get session data for editing"

SELECT startTime, endTime
	FROM Session
		WHERE id={java sessionID}

for each row in barcode file:
	if timeScanned is between startTime and endTime:
		SELECT id,name
			FROM Student
				WHERE barcode={java barcodeNumber}
		(keep for later)

show results, ask if it's OK

for each (java) studentID:
	UPDATE Attendance
		SET status="present"
		WHERE studentID = {java studentID}
			AND sessionID = {java sessionID}
